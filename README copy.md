## 1. About the Library

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language very popular among developers. It is used in many platforms that handle plain text (GitHub, forums, blogs, ...) and it's very common to find several files in that format in any kind of repository (starting with the traditional `README.md`).

These `Markdown` files usually contain _links_ (links) which are often broken or no longer or no longer valid and this greatly impairs the value of the information to be shared.

Within an open source community, we have been proposed to create a tool using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), that reads and parses files in the `Markdown` format to verify the links they contain and report some statistics.
